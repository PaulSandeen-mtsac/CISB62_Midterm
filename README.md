Mt. SAC CISB 62 Midterm Project - Lung Cancer Image Analysis Using Deep Learning

Lung cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer worldwide. The primary risk factor is smoking tobacco cigarettes. There are two major types of lung cancer: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) which accounts for 85% of cases and Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) which makes up the remaining 15%. There are different sub-types of NSCLC, with lung adenocarcinoma being the most common.

Under a microscope, adenocarcinoma tumors can appear as a solid mass or as mix of solid and gland-like structures.
This project uses a public image data set that contains image data with 10,000 lung cell images, 5,000 showing normal (negative for cancer) cells and 5,000 showing cells with adenocarcinoma (positive for cancer). Each image is a color 768 X 768 pixel JPEG file.

This Jupyter notebook shows a run using all 10,000 images scaled down to 128 pixel by 128 pixel images with three color channels (red, green, and blue).
